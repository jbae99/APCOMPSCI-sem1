-Java scripts are just text files
-create a text file (ending in .java) and drag into notepad++
-start with public class filename (filename must be identical to file name)
-open {
-public static void main(String[]args)
-PRINT STATEMENT: System.out.println("Hello World")

-Files must be compiled before they can be executed
-already made compile+run 
-remember to save new exec scripts if i wanna use them frequently
-.class files are the text files + bytecode that allows java to run it
-certain characters wont be printed unless "escaped"; these include "\, and must be escaped by using \
