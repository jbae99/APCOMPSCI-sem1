Int: numerical values, a 32-bit signed two's complement integer. generally used as default type for integral values
unless there is a memory issue. Min is -2^31, max is 2^31 - 1
Double: decimal values, any real number
boolean: true false statements, like a switch. default is false
float: singe-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point. used to save memory in large arrays of floating point #s
char: a single 16-bit Unicode character, min val is \u0000, max val is \uffff. used to store any character
short: a 16-bit signed two's complement integer, min value is -32,768 (-2^15), max is 32,767 (2^15 -1), takes up 
less memory than int
long:64-bit singed two's complement integer. min is -2^63, max is 2^63 - 1.  Generally used when a wider range than
int is needed

variables can represent any data
they can be used for functions
you can add 2 strings together,called "concatenation"
