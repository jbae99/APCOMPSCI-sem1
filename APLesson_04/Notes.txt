%f: 
when is it used:holds the place of a variable in a statement, speciically  float and double
How does it work: displays a floating point value in decimal format
provide examples:
double ex = 5.6
System.out.println ("Variable ex is %f", ex);


%d: 
when do you use it: holds the place of a variable in a statement, specifically short, byte, int, or long
how does it work: displays a decimal integer
provide examples:  System.out.printf ("Welcome to %s", str);, 
assuming str is given a meaning, %s tells the code where to place the variable in the string


%s:
when do you use it: holds the place of a variable in a statement, specifically strings
how does it work: displays strings
provide examples:


%#s formats a column, so to speak.  It will line up all characters up to the point where the # is reached


Creating a new method essentially stores some information that we can refer back to at any point repeatedly
its kind of like a variable but for an equation or for a format or something of the like




accessType returnType methodName(parameters)

accesType: whether the method can be pulled from outside the class
returnType: dictates what type of date is being returned(int, string, etc...)
methodName: identifier
parameters: lets us input data into the method


1. public methods can be accessed by programs and classes outside of the script

2. The main method must be static because non static methods must have an object to run off of, 
and since there are no objects when our code initially runs, we must have it as static so there
is an entry point in the code

3. Parameters are what allow us to enter data into the method,
